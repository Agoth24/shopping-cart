This is a simple React application that allows users to create a reading list of books from a bookstore. Users can add new books, view the list of existing books, and remove books from their list.
## Features
- Add new books to their list
- View a list of all books
- Remove books from the list
## Technologies Used
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
### Notes
- The Books selected here are from a reading list I found online; the link will be attached soon
    - Check /assets/books.js for the raw JSON file
- The JSON file was created by writing an asynchronous script that fetches from the (OpenLibrary)[openlibrary.org] API, the code can be found in /hooks/useBooksFetcher.jsx.
